<h1>We were fine, until 'Goodbye' became the line</h1>
</header>
<section>
<p class="line1">We were something in between,</p>
<p class="line2">More than friends, but less than what love means.</p>
<p class="line3">There was a spark we never named,</p>
<p class="line4">We are a story that stayed unnamed.</p>
<br>
<p class="line5">You laughed with me like I was home,</p>
<p class="line6">You made me believe I’d never be alone.</p>
<p class="line7">It felt like love, it felt so right,</p>
<p class="line8">Yet it faded away on a random Thursday night.</p>
<br>
<p class="line9">I thought I knew you, every part of you,</p>
<p class="line10">But now I’m left asking, “Who are you?”</p>
<p class="line11">You were so afraid that I might leave,</p>
<p class="line12">But in the end, it was you who chose to leave.</p>
<br>
<p class="line13">You were never mine, yet I grieve,</p>
<p class="line14">For a love I held but can't receive.</p>
<p class="line15">How do I unlove what I can’t define,</p>
<p class="line16">When all I wanted was to call you mine?</p>
<br>
<p class="line17">I drown in moments we never owned,</p>
<p class="line18">In you, where quietly my heart had grown.</p>
<p class="line19">You were a chapter I couldn’t write,</p>
<p class="line20">A stolen dawn that never turned to night.</p>
<br>
<p class="line21">Now I’m haunted by the nights we shared,</p>
<p class="line22">By heavy words that proved you cared.</p>
<p class="line23">But if you cared, then tell me why,</p>
<p class="line24">You left me broken, you let me cry.</p>
<br>
<p class="line25">The hardest part I can’t deny,</p>
<p class="line26">Is loving someone who was never mine.</p>
<p class="line27">I beg my heart to let you go,</p>
<p class="line28">But love holds on when the mind says no.</p>
<br>
<p class="line29">And maybe what hurts is not the end,</p>
<p class="line30">But knowing we bent what we couldn’t mend.</p>
<p class="line31">Perhaps in another time, another place,</p>
<p class="line32">I might have found in you my safe space.</p>
